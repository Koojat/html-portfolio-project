<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aizat Bin Rusli, and I currently work as an editor at TKC Southern Sdn Bhd. Based in the beautiful town of Seri Manjung, Perak, I find joy in transforming raw content into polished pieces that resonate with audiences. My role allows me to engage with various forms of media, and I take pride in ensuring that every project meets the highest standards of quality and creativity.</p>
<p>I pursued my education at Politeknik Ungku Omar, where I earned a Diploma in Electronic Communication. This academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in both technical skills and creative thinking, which I apply daily in my editing work. The blend of technology and artistry fascinates me, and I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest trends in the industry.</p>
<p>Outside of my professional life, I have a passion for image editing and hiking. Editing images allows me to express my creativity, while hiking connects me with nature and offers a refreshing escape from the daily grind. Whether I'm on a challenging trail or fine-tuning a visual project, I embrace every opportunity to grow and explore new horizons.</p>
